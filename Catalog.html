				<tr class="lkl">
					<td> The three frames of the Mairin LED ceiling light have a matt nickel finish. The arrangement of the frames in relation to one another is particularly attractive. This clearly sets it apart from other ceiling lights. However, this light also has many other advantages: you can use the included remote control to seamlessly dim the light and to seamlessly adjust the luminous colour from warm white to daylight. As far as the light output is concerned, the light leaves nothing to be desired. </td>

The LEDs fit around the spiral like a strip and you can use the normal wall switch to adjust the light output in three levels and to adapt it better to the situation in the room. </td>

					<td> Saliha looks very elegant with its looped curves, which give it a dynamic touch. It blends well with modern interiors. The nickel finish emphasises the modern effect and the LEDs belong to the brightest and most energy-saving light sources. For even more comfort the LED ceiling lamp can be dimmed to one of three available levels via a standard wall switch. </td>

					<td> Simple, modern and linear - this is the Vika LED ceiling lamp. The square, white painted aluminium body surrounds a satin white polycarbonate diffuser, which guarantees glare-free lighting. There are LEDs concealed behind the diffuser. They emit a very cosy, warm white light. Vika is suitable for installation on either the ceiling or the wall and is therefore extremely versatile. All the installation parts are hidden by the aluminium frame so that no screws are visible. </td>

				<tr>
					<td> Jelle convinces with a very aesthetic design and a particularly beautiful lighting effect that radiates pure cosiness. The wall luminaire is operated with LEDs, which are located behind the convex designed cover and illuminate the concave element on the wall. These LEDs are efficient and therefore both bright and energy-saving, which is exactly the combination that consumers want. Due to the panel-shaped design of the light body, the light can be emitted upwards and downwards without any glare. This type of lighting is very comfortable and can be used in the corridor as well as in living rooms and bedrooms. The harmonious expression is enhanced by the completely white surface of the aluminium - ideal for many modern rooms! </td>

					<td colspan=4><h2> Jolin ground spike light with LED, solar-operated </h2></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> Ground spike lights are always advantageous when you want to create a flexible lighting solution outside. They can be placed in any lawn or flowerbed and can be quickly fixed into the soft ground via the ground spike. When using solar lights you also avoid unnecessary cable tangling or an annoying search for a suitable power source as the light is charged by the power of the sun alone. There is also no need to consider the power costs and consumption. The solar light has an integrated twilight sensor and the light duration is 8 hours.

If you remove the ground spike, you also have the option of fixing the light to a solid surface. Screw holes are located on the mounting bracket.

					<td> Discreet path lamp Kristof with a stainless steel body and polycarbonate lampshade.

Value is often attached to a discreet design in modern environments in particular. The path lamp Kristof in a round cylindrical shape is recommended for anyone who would like to dispense with superfluous details. The bottom part of the light, along with the base, is made from stainless steel, and the light bulb socket, which is covered by an opal white polycarbonate diffuser, is in the top part. Consequently, the light appears really even and is free from disruptive glare. </td>
